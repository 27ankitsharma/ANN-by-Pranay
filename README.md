# ArtificialNeuralNets
This is an application of Artificial Neural Network on the famous adult dataset. This also uses grid search to find out the best hyperparameters for the model.
You would find that the grid search do not give very different results from the base model. 
As Andrew Ng put it in his Deep Learning Coursera course - Random Search is better. :)
